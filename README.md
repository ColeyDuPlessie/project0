Hello! Welcome to my project0 project! I chose to make my website about First Lego League (FLL) and my team's adventures in FLL over the years. So, I'll jump right into it!

On the homepage, we find a paragraph of text followed by a list and some divs of class "centered." Then, we find 2 forms with 1 submit type button each. The top one takes you to WhatIsFLL.html, and the bottom one takes you to History.html. I did not use bootstrap on the homepage, instead using _css/stylesheet.css for my stylesheet.

On WhatIsFLL, I used Bootstrap and my stylesheet. I have two buttons at the top, Back and Read about our history, followed by three columns and a button to go to WhatIsRobot.html. Then I have some more text, followed by a video in a jumbotron.

On History, I have a paragraph followed by a ordered list, another paragraph, a unordered list and finally, a back button.

On WhatIsRobot.html, There is a back button at the top, followed by a paragraph, a unordered list and another paragraph. There is a picture to the right of the text.
  
Finally, I have _css/stylesheet.css and _scss/stylesheet.scss, which are my stylesheets in css and sass respectively.
